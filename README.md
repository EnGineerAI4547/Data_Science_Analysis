# Data Science, Data Engineering, and Data Analytics

This repository is dedicated to my exploration of various data-related topics, including big data queries, data queries, database creation and modification, data representation and visualization, predictive analytics, data pipeline engineering, model creation and implementation, web scraping, data cleaning, and other related subjects. I will be using Python, C#, C, C++, Java, Rust, HTML, CSS, JS, R, and potentially other programming languages for my implementations.

## Daily Code Commits

I will aim to make weekly contributions to this repository, but the frequency of my contributions is flexible.
